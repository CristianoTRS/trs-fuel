Hi guys! First things first you need some explanation. This script was made for a server a while ago but they never ended using it. I spoke to them and they allowed me to release it.

The fuel system is very basic, like the simplest that could ever be made. What changes is the UI. There is a UI when you are going to fill your vehicle.

<h1> Requirements: </h1>

* [es_extended](https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended)

<h1> Features: </h1>

* Each vehicle has their own fuel tank size (could be changed in config.lua)
* You can fill your vehicle with a specific number of litters.
* You can't fill some vehicles (bikes, airplanes, etc... it also can be changed)
* Yes, this does contain an animation which is longer according to the amount of fuel (can be changed.)

As I said before, the main fueling system is very basic but i think this will make your fueling system a little more interactive just like real life.

**Thanks, Cristiano.**
